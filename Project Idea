Project Idea


The name of the app I decided to base my final project on is called Vinyl First. The general idea behind the app is to teach the target population 5 quick reasons learning to DJ on vinyl first is important. Keeping in mind our final project would be to create an app that supplied some educational value, I decided to go with something that is close to my heart. Having been a DJ for over 12 years in addition to DJ instructor, a common question I hear from new perspective DJ’s is wether or not they should learn to DJ on turntables or a laptop with aid from their choice of software. While both have pros and cons, I wanted to focus on the advantages of learning to DJ with vinyl first.
The app will provide the target user with five compelling reasons they should consider vinyl first when making their decision. The apps is interactive so each view is clickable and links to various video tutorials with helpful tips for new perspective DJ’s. In addition I added a link to more in depth reading should a user like to learn more on the advantages of learning on vinyl first.
As a long time DJ with a stint as in instructor, I felt like I was a natural fit to design this app.
